# Sonoff-S20-MQTT-IO
 Sonoff S20 Wifi Smart Socket MQTT Control

Inside the Sonoff S20 smart socket a ESP8266 is build in and can be reprogrammed

!! always disconnect from mains when opening the housing of the Sonoff S20 !!

!! during programming the Sonoff S20 is always disconnected from mains !!

!! only connect to mains when the housing is properly closed !!

For programming and power supply the internal CPU use a USB-FTDI-RS232 adapter.
On the pcb of the Sonoff S20 there is a row of solder pads to place a header to the USB-FTDI-RS232 adapter

To get the Sonoff S20 in program mode; hold the push botton and then connect the USB-FTDI-RS232 adapter to your computer.

The software the Sonoff S20 is a nearly 100% copy of my ESP8266-MQTT-IO project
